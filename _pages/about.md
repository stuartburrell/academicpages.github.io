I am a PhD student in pure mathematics and part of the analysis research group at the University of St Andrews.

My current research is on fractal geometry and related fields in analysis, supervised by Dr Jonathan Fraser and Professor Kenneth Falconer, and funded by a scholarship from the Carnegie Trust.

A CV is available here. When not doing Mathematics, you'll find me rock climbing or in the beautiful mountains of Scotland.
